      <h2>Project Synopsis</h2>
      <p>
        FiTR is an innovative web application designed to streamline the job
        matching process by connecting job seekers with employers based
        primarily on location and key skills. Modeled after a “dating app”
        format, users swipe left or right on job listings to indicate whether
        they possess the necessary skills for a given position. When a match
        occurs between a job seeker and an employer, a brief 5-10 minute
        interview is scheduled, allowing both parties to assess if they wish to
        continue the hiring process. Beyond facilitating quick connections, FiTR
        provides valuable insights for employers, educators, and job seekers.
        Employers can compare skills to other job postings, educators can
        identify in-demand skills, and job seekers can evaluate how their skills
        measure up against others in the industry. The platform highlights the
        skills users possess while identifying any gaps in their expertise. For
        job seekers seeking to enhance their qualifications, FiTR offers
        educational resources to acquire the necessary skills, paving the way
        for improved employability. Overall, FiTR is a comprehensive,
        professional career platform that simplifies the job search process for
        job seekers, employers, and educators alike. It empowers individuals to
        understand the skills they need to secure employment while fostering
        growth opportunities for career advancement.
