        <h2>Project Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
          Despite many jobs and education sites, the Skills Gap is growing. We
          want to create easily accessible, user-friendly software to match
          skills to jobs better. The original project was to align employers
          with educators to provide custom education roadmaps for job candidates
          based on their current abilities and missing skills needed to apply to
          greater job opportunities. The first group sponsored at RIT focused on
          developing a skills training and talent acquisition platform to give
          candidates a more transparent educational roadmap to jobs they want
          and contact with the employers that align with the skills being
          acquired. After more research, we pivoted with our second and third
          teams to focus on fast candidate-toemployee connections with a more
          dating app format.
